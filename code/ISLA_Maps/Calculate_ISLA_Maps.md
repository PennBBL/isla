This document shows how to create ISLA images from the PNC datafreeze images. The following is just a walk through of the code; to execute it, a working version of the `imco` package is necessary, which currently only works on *singularity*.

First, gather the data and run `imco()`, which you can find in [this script](). The sample selection criteria can be examined [here](https://github.com/PennBBL/isla/blob/master/code/ReproducibilityScripts/n1601_SampleCreationNotebook.md).


```bash
# the value we're correlating with GMD
modality=cbf

# find the mask and the participant sample
cbfMask=/data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/data/Masks/gm10perc_PcaslCoverageMask.nii.gz
cbfParticipants=/data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/data/cbfSample.csv

head $cbfParticipants
```

    "","bblid","scanid"

    "2",80607,2647
    "3",80249,2648

    "7",80575,2725
    "8",80425,2726
    "9",81287,2738


You can test your call to IMCo with a single participant:


```bash
bblid=81287
scanid=2738
output_images=/data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/data/imco1/gmd_$modality/$bblid

echo Done!
```

    Done!


Next, we extrapolate the maps using the script `Extrapolate.R`:


```bash
Rscript /data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/code/ISLA_Maps/Extrapolate.R $output_images $bblid $scanid $modality
```

    Loading required package: oro.nifti
    oro.nifti 0.9.9
    
    Attaching package: â€˜dplyrâ€™
    
    The following object is masked from â€˜package:oro.niftiâ€™:
    
        slice
    
    The following objects are masked from â€˜package:statsâ€™:
    
        filter, lag
    
    The following objects are masked from â€˜package:baseâ€™:
    
        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    
    Predict GMD=1 successful
    Predict GMD + slope successful
    Y image read in successful
    Complete


Lastly, we calculate the difference maps using `Calculate_Diff_Map.R`, which takes the same inputs:


```bash
Rscript /data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/code/ISLA_Maps/Calculate_Diff_Map.R $output_images $bblid $scanid $modality
```

    Loading required package: oro.nifti
    oro.nifti 0.9.9
    Loading required package: neurobase
    
    Attaching package: â€˜dplyrâ€™
    
    The following objects are masked from â€˜package:data.tableâ€™:
    
        between, first, last
    
    The following object is masked from â€˜package:oro.niftiâ€™:
    
        slice
    
    The following objects are masked from â€˜package:statsâ€™:
    
        filter, lag
    
    The following objects are masked from â€˜package:baseâ€™:
    
        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    
    Isla read in successful
    Y image read in successful
    Complete


Now, for each of the images created, we want to modify the names such that they are compliant with our naming conventions. This is `{scanid}_imageName_vox{size}.nii.gz`, and for this we use the script `TidyRename.R`:


```bash
# note that the $modality flag has been replaced with the voxel size
Rscript /data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/code/ISLA_Maps/TidyRename.R $output_images $bblid $scanid $size
```

        intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    
    [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
    Files renamed successfully



```bash
echo $output_images
ls $output_images
```

(I think there's an error in the encoding of printed tabs when this is converted to .md)

I decided to wrap these three steps into one `Rscript`, `Extrap_Diff_Tidy.R`, because the process is bottlenecked by jumping in and out of R session. You can call it like so:


```bash

bblid=81287
scanid=2738
