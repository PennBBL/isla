This document shows how to reproduce ISLA maps for a small sample of participants. The following is just a walk through of the code; to execute it, a working version of the `imco` package is necessary, which currently only works on *singularity*.

```{r}
# Libraries, again, available on the singularity docker

# library(parallel)
# library(methods)
# library(stringr)
# library(fslr)
# library(ANTsR)
# library(extrantsr)
# library(rlist)
# library(dplyr)
# library(imco)
```

Reading in the samples:

```{r}
cbf=read.csv("/data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/results/Reproducibility/cbfSample.csv")
reho_alff=read.csv("/data/jux/BBL/projects/isla/results/Reproducibility/restSample.csv")
```
